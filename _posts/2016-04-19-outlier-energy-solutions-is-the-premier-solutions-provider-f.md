Outlier Energy Solutions is the premier solutions provider for on-site clean energy facilities. As a private, on-site utility solutions provider, Outlier provides a comprehensive approach for government, medical, commercial, multi-family residential and industrial customers that includes a facility-specific combination of energy efficiency upgrades coupled with on-site combined heat and power (CHP) plants. 

The goal of each Outlier project is to design or retrofit your facilities to the most practical energy efficiency standards and to combine those measures with a CHP plant that generates the electricity, cooling and heating the facility needs to operate. Combined, this approach produces the lowest Total Cost of Energy for our clients.
